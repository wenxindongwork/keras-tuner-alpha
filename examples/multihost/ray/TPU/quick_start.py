"""Quick Start Example

This script demonstrates how to run LoRA SFT on a toy dataset

1. Load HuggingFace Gemma2 checkpoint
2. Configure data loading and preprocessing
3. Run training across TPU/GPU devices

This script can be run on both single-host and multi-host. 
For mulit-host set up, please follow https://kithara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scaling_with_ray.html.


Singlehost: python examples/singlehost/quick_start.py 
Multihost:  python ray/submit_job.py "python3.11 examples/multihost/ray/TPU/quick_start.py" --hf-token your_token
